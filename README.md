#About Project
A responsive image gallery that allows users to drag and drop images in an order of their choice. A login and register form was implemented using ReactJS and Firebase to add more interaction between the users and the gallery. A search function was also integrated to allow users to search for images in the gallery.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
